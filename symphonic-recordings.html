    <title>AFM EMSD: Symphonic Recordings</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Symphonic Agreements</h1>
    <p>Symphonic orchestras with a Local CBA are eligible to become signatory to the AFM Integrated Media Agreement (IMA) which governs release provisions for certain kinds of audio and audiovisual media, provided that the Orchestra retains ownership of the product. </p>
    <p>Some types of release are excluded from coverage in the IMA, however, and would therefore be bound by (potentially) non-symphonic recording language.</p>
    <p>Local radio and television is excluded by the IMA, which may be covered by the Local CBA. Each AFM Local is permitted to set the terms and conditions for geographically <a href="local-media.html">local radio and television broadcast</a>.</p>
    <p>Audio studio recordings are excluded from the IMA and are covered by the <a href="srla-symphonic.html">Sound Recording Labor Agreement.</a></p>
    <p>Commercial television is excluded and reverts to whichever type of <a href="film-and-tv.html">television agreement</a> is appropriate for the broadcast in question. </p>
    <p>If you have further questions about recordings of symphonic orchestras, please contact the AFMâ€™s Symphonic Services Division, who may in turn later include Electronic Media Services.</p>
