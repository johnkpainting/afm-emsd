    <title>AFM EMSD: SRLA Licensing Provisions</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>SRLA Licensing Provisions</h1>
    <p>When “covered product,” either a phonograph record (meaning any album track recorded pursuant to the SRLA,) a Covered Concert DVD, or Traditional Music Video, is used in another medium, an additional payment is generated. Generally, that payment would be the applicable wages owed under the agreement that covers the new medium. For example, when a pop single is used in a commercial, payments to the musicians on the recording are made as if the musicians performed a session under the Commercial Announcements Agreement. This concept is called “<a href="new-use.html">New Use</a>.” </p>
    <p>However, this is not always the case. Sometimes, when SRLA product is licensed at a low fee, payments are only made to our affiliated funds, such as the Pension Fund (AFM-EPF), the Special Payments Fund (SPF), or the Music Performance Trust Fund (MPTF).</p>
