    <h1>Industrial Films</h1>
    <p>Underscoring is not only done for motion pictures intended for theatrical release. Sometimes a film or video may be produced for a things like a convention, trade show, in-house corporate use, or museum kiosks. These are non-theatrical, non-television films, perhaps better termed as “non-broadcast” films. Such underscoring work falls under the AFM’s <b>Industrial Films Agreement</b>.</p>
    <p>These projects, however, are increasingly rare. As social media becomes an increasingly dominant force, the odds that a film would be completely “non-broadcast” are diminishing. Moreover, if there is a cost of admission required for the public to view the film (i.e. a special exhibit at a museum that has a separate charge,) then such a film would be deemed theatrical.</p>
    <p>All industrial film work is filed on an AFM B-7 Report Form.</p>
