<body>
    <h1>Sound Recording Labor Agreement</h1>
    <p>The <b>Sound Recording Labor Agreement</b> (SRLA) covers the performance of instrumental musicians, or as leaders, arrangers, orchestrators, and copyists in the production of recorded music intended for public sale or distribution, as well as on-camera work in the creation of music videos. </p>
    <p>A traditional session (called a “Basic Regular Session”) is three hours in length and allows for the capture of up to 15 minutes of final product. A basic session may also be called to “sweeten” up to four tracks recorded at a previous session.</p>
    <p>A record label may also call a “Special Session,” which is 1 ½ hours in length and provides for the recording of up to 7 ½ minutes of music, provided that the musicians are notified at the time they are engaged that the session will be a Special Session.</p>
    <p>All work during these types of sessions is filed on an AFM B-4 Report Form.</p>
