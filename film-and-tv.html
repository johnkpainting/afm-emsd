    <h1>Film &amp; Television</h1>
    <p>The AFM has a wide variety of agreements covering film and television work. If you’re unfamiliar with how they work, then it’s difficult to know where to begin.</p>
    <p>The first distinction is that the work of a musician varies depending on the type of production being made. Work done for “television” may vary wildly from project to project. The AFM makes a distinction between work that normally requires underscoring or has a narrative structure (covered by the Film Agreements) and variety-type work that’s normally broadcast live or as-live (covered by the Live Television Agreements).</p>
    <h2>Film Agreements</h2>
    <p>The AFM’s film agreements are negotiated with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) and covers in-studio work (“scoring”) as well as on-camera appearances by musicians (“sidelining”). This type work can be done for either theatrical release or for a television series. Also included here are Industrial Films, which are similarly underscored, but are not broadcast outside a specific location or event.</p>

    <h2>Live Television Agreements</h2>
    <p>The Live Television Agreements are a family of agreements that cover variety-type programming intended to be broadcast live or as-live, such as morning shows, daytime and late night talk shows, sketch comedy shows, award shows, game shows, sports, and other specials. For historical purposes, these agreements also cover “daytime serials” (soap operas.)</p>
