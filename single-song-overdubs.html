    <title>AFM: Single Song Overdub Scale</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Single Song Overdub Scale</h1>
    <p>If you need a musician to record an overdub part for your independent project, you don’t necessarily need to call that musician into a studio in order to get that work covered under an AFM contract. After all, musicians often have studios capable of such a recording in their own homes.</p>
    <p>The <b>Single Song Overdub Agreement</b> is a contract between the Producer, the individual musician, and the Local establishing an all-inclusive “per-song” rate, which includes scale wages, health and welfare contributions, pension contributions, and any electronic transaction fees, as established on the Compensation Chart.</p>
    <p>The individual musician then files the agreement and appropriate AFM B-17 Report Form with the Local of record and the Pension Fund.</p>
    <p>This agreement may be combined with a Local Limited Pressing Agreement and all standard union protections apply.</p>
