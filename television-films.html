    <h1>Television Films</h1>
    <p>The AFM’s <b>Basic Television Motion Picture Agreement</b> covers musicians who are employed by employers for the production of “television motion pictures,” which means films initially released in free television. This does not necessarily mean a “TV movie,” but covers any project with a narrative structure, one that usually requires underscoring, like scripted dramas, sitcoms, and reality shows. More recently, this has expanded to also include television series that traditionally would be covered by this agreement that are initially produced for new media platforms.</p>
    <p>This agreement includes <a href="low-budget-television-films.html">low budget provisions</a>, which requires the project to fall under a certain budget limit while also guaranteeing the employment of a specific minimum number of musicians.</p>
    <p>All television film work is filed on an AFM B-7 Report Form.</p>
