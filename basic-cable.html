    <h1>Basic Cable Agreement</h1>
    <p>Similar to the <a href="videotape.html">Live Television (Videotape) Agreement</a>, the AFM <b>Basic Cable Agreement</b> covers musicians engaged for variety programming intended to air on basic cable networks.</p>
    <p>As in the Videotape Agreement for network television, work is assumed to be on-camera, so the rates herein cover both audio and visual capture. The actual program rates themselves depend on two factors: how long the program is and how often it airs. Based on that, a show’s “minimum call” rate will comprise the “air rate” for time spent taping the show as well as a minimum number of required rehearsal hours.</p>
    <p>However, the replay patterns differ; the rates paid under Basic Cable allow a producer to air the program on 10 “play dates” over a 12-month time span. Re-use cycles are, therefore, paid for future years of exhibition, in which future years allow for 12 additional “play dates” each.</p>
    <p>Premium channels, such as HBO, are not considered Basic Cable. Programs produced for premium channels are covered by the AFM <a href="pay-television.html">Non-Standard Television Agreement</a>.</p>
    <p>All basic cable work is filed on an AFM B-8 Report Form.</p>
