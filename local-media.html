    <title>AFM EMSD: Local Media Agreements</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Information for Local Media</h1>
    <p>Some AFM agreements allow flexibility for media content that is produced and distributed locally, that is to say, within a confined geographical area.</p>
    <p><b>Made and Played Commercial Announcements</b> are for single market advertisers whose product or service is broadcast only within the jurisdiction of the Local in which it was recorded. Designed for small businesses in areas with smaller Locals, this agreement provides a discounted session rate and no back-end obligations, unless the commercial moves to a wider scope or the music is used in another medium. An agreement must be signed between the Local and the Employer and the work is filed on an AFM B-3 Report Form. Please contact your nearest Local for more information.</p>
    <p>The <b>Local Broadcast Media Agreement</b> allows Locals to establish rates and conditions for the employment of musicians on local television and radio programming. As with the above commercials agreement, the broadcast must be limited to the jurisdiction of the Local in which it was recorded. An agreement must be signed between the Local and the Employer; television work is filed on an AFM B-8 Report Form, while radio work is filed on an AFM B-10 Report Form. Please contact your nearest Local for more information.</p>
    <p>Please keep in mind that if commercials or media broadcasts are disseminated via the Internet, then it has not been limited to the geographical jurisdiction of the Local and these local agreements do not apply.</p>
