    <title>AFM EMSD: Sidelining</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Sidelining</h1>
    <p>In the creation of motion pictures, musicians might not be hired for just underscoring. On many occasions, musicians are required to appear on camera. In order to look realistic in a scene, producers will hire professional musicians to mime to a recording while on camera. This is referred to as “sidelining.” Under both the Theatrical Motion Picture and Television Motion Picture Agreements, these on-camera musicians are paid under Section IV. for “Sideline Musicians.”</p>
    <p>Sidelining rates are the same across all film contracts and do not contain any low budget options. All sidelining work is filed on an AFM B-7 Report Form.</p>
