    <h1>Demos</h1>
    <p>Demos are recordings that are intended to display a piece or performance for the purposes of, well, demonstration, as well as for attempts to find financial backers for a project. They are, inherently, non-broadcast in nature. If a recording is intended to be distributed to the general public at large, the demonstration agreement terms do not apply.</p>
    <p>AFM Locals administrate their own <a href="audio-demos.html">Audio Demonstration Recording</a> agreements for the capture of music for such purposes. This agreement contains an additional payment for video capture, though the usage is limited to that which would normally be covered by an Electronic Press Kit.</p>
    <p>Full visual capture of live performances for demonstration purposes is generally not covered, aside from, in limited circumstances, by the Limited Release DVD Agreement or by the Audition language in the Television Videotape Agreement. </p>
