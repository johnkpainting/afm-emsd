<body>
    <h1>Commercial Announcements</h1>
    <p>The <b>Commercial Announcements Agreement</b> covers musicians employed to record the music tracks to be used in the production of commercials in any medium (television, radio, Internet, etc.) The agreement also includes separate provisions for musicians engaged to appear on camera.</p>
    <p>Musicians must be paid for session work and will also receive residual payments in the form of “cycles,” depending on how the music is used and how the commercials are aired.</p>
    <p>All commercial announcements session work and residual payments are filed on an AFM B-6 Report Form.</p>
    <p>Music recorded under the Sound Recording Labor Agreement (SRLA) may be licensed for use in commercials. In this case, the SRLA’s licensing provisions do not apply and all payments that would have been required if the music had been recorded as a commercial in the first place will be required. For more information, see <a href="new-use.html">New Use</a>.</p>
    <p>Single market advertisers, usually small businesses, in areas with small AFM Locals, may file their work under the <a href="local-media.html">Made and Played Commercial Announcements Agreement</a>. </p>
