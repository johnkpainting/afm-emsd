    <h1>Video Game Agreement</h1>
    <p>The studio work for musicians providing underscoring for video games is not dissimilar from the work done for underscoring motion pictures. As a result, the AFMâ€™s <b>Video Game Agreement</b> rates are determined by the size of the orchestra, much like in Theatrical Motion Picture, with a lower hourly rate for orchestras of 25 players or more. </p>
    <p>All video game work is filed on an AFM B-7 Report Form.</p>
