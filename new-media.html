<body>
    <h1>New Media</h1>
    <p>“New media” is a catch-all term referring to methods of content distribution that differs from “old media,” which refers to things like analog broadcast television, feature films, and radio. “New media” are forms of media that are computational and rely on computers for redistribution. This includes the Internet, social media and social networking services, over-the-top streaming services, etc. </p>
    <p>Many AFM agreements contain provisions that indicate what happens if material is exhibited on new media, or in many cases, even when it’s made for new media. For example, when <a href="sound-recordings.html">Sound Recordings</a> are accessed on streaming platforms, a residual payment is due into a number of AFM funds. <a href="theatrical-motion-picture.html">Motion pictures</a> and <a href="television-films.html">television series</a> made for New Media platforms are covered by sideletters to the film agreements. Advertisements on new media platforms are also covered under the <a href="commercials.html">Commercial Announcements Agreement</a>.</p>
    <p>The explicit capture and broadcast of live events on <a href="streaming.html">Internet streaming sites</a> are covered by individual letters of agreement. </p>
    <p>There is no stand-alone “New Media” AFM Agreement, so if you are unsure where your project may fit, please call your Local or the Federation.</p>
