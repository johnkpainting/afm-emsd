    <title>AFM EMSD: Sound Recordings</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Sound Recordings</h1>
    <p>The Sound Recording Labor Agreement (SRLA) covers the performance of instrumental musicians, or as leaders, arrangers, orchestrators, and copyists in the production of recorded music intended for public sale or distribution, as well as on-camera work in the creation of music videos. The AFM negotiates this agreement with representatives from the major record labels. </p>
    <p>Aside from full “regular” Sound Recording Scale, in which 15 minute of final product may be produced from a 3-hour call, discounted rates are available for Low Budget projects, as well as “Special Sessions,” shorter calls to produce less finished product.</p>
    <p>AFM Locals are permitted to set their own rates for projects that will not reach a threshold of sales to qualify for back-end payments, including Limited Pressings and Demonstration Recordings. Moreover, home studio work for small projects may be covered as Single Song Overdubs and self-contained groups may file Joint Ventures without any monetary obligations.</p>
