    <h1>Country Music Television Agreement</h1>
    <p>Musicians engaged for programming on Country Music Television (CMT) are paid according to terms in a separately negotiated collective bargaining agreement, which bears some similarities to network television and cable television.</p>
    <p>As with the Television Videotape, the rates are determined by the length of the program and consists of an “air rate” plus rehearsal time. Unlike network television, there is only one pattern of rates, rather than changing the rates based on how often the program airs.</p>
    <p>As with the Basic Cable and Pay Cable agreements, the initial payment covers an initial broadcast window, rather than one airing. Under CMT, that initial window is 36-months in length, during which the program may air on 12 different “play dates”.</p>
    <p>All work for CMT is filed on an AFM B-8 Report Form.</p>
