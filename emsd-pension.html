    <title>AFM EMSD: Current Pension Rates</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Pension Contributions</h1>
    <p>All scale wages (with very limited exceptions) paid under AFM collective bargaining agreements require an additional contribution payment be made to the AFM and Employers’ Pension Fund at a specific percentage of that scale. The percentage varies depending on the CBA, but has also been increased as a result of the Fund’s Rehabilitation Plan. As a result of those increases, there may often be confusion as to the correct rate at any given time. </p>
    <p>Below, please find a full list of current pension contribution rates, by CBA. These rates are inclusive of the 2018 “Rehab 2” increase, unless otherwise noted: </p>
