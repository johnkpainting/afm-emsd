    <title>AFM EMSD: Symphonic/Chamber SRLA</title>

    <h1>Symphonic and Chamber Sound Recordings</h1>
    <p>The basic session rates provided for in the SRLA generally refer to non-symphonic productions. Work by symphony and chamber orchestras is governed by a separate set of terms and conditions. While the per-musician session rate is higher, the agreement allows for more minutes of music to be recorded during such a session.</p>
    <p>These rates cover in-studio work done by such orchestras. If an orchestra is signed to the Integrated Media Agreement (IMA), that agreement covers the release of live concert recordings. However, the IMA does not cover studio sessions, so even if a symphony is signed to the IMA, they would still have to pay symphonic SRLA rates for studio work.</p>
    <p>All symphonic and chamber orchestra study work is filed on an AFM B-4 Report Form.</p>
