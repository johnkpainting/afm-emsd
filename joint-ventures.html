    <h1>Joint Venture Agreements</h1>
    <p>AFM recording agreements are required when someone <i>hires</i> a musician to provide a musical service. However, what happens if there is no musician being <i>hired</i>, per se? What happens if a self-contained band rents studio time to cut an album? If nobody is hiring them, do they not need a union contract? Is the band then not protected if those songs get licensed into another project?  </p>
    <p>If all musicians on a recording project are part-owners of the project and all benefit from any potential sales, then the musicians can file a <b>Joint Venture Agreement</b> with their Local in order to ensure that the project is on file with the union, even when no money changes hands.  </p>
