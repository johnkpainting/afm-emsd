    <h1>Radio Agreements</h1>
    <p>The AFM negotiates its radio agreement terms with Minnesota Public Radio (MPR), which produces <i>Live From Here</i> (formerly known as <i>A Prairie Home Companion</i>). The AFM then promulgates that rate for other NPR productions to its more generalized Public Radio Agreement. </p>
    <p>Those rates are also applied on a case-by-case basis for syndicated, satellite, or Internet radio productions.</p>
    <p>Our radio agreements contain rates for in-studio work (paid by program length) as well as for the capture and broadcast of live performances and concerts. A separate, higher rate is applied when such a capture is “segmented” and aired as an individual piece, rather than aired as a complete concert.</p>
    <p>All radio work is filed on an AFM B-10 Report Form.</p>
