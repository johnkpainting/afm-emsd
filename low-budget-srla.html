    <h1>Low Budget Sound Recordings</h1>
    <p>You may be eligible to utilize “low budget” sound recording rates, rather than the full rates of a regular session, provided that the entire budget for your full album project is under $99,000. For projects that are fewer than 12 tracks in length, this budget threshold is prorated on a per-track basis.</p>
    <p>These rates cannot be used for soundtrack albums or theatrical cast albums. Theatrical producers might be eligible to record at a discounted rate under <a href="limited-pressings.html">Schedule B of the Limited Pressing Agreement</a>, provided that the production is not eligible for a Tony Award.</p>
    <p>All work during low budget sessions, like regular sessions, is filed on an AFM B-4 Report Form.</p>
