<body>
    <h1>Recordings in Canada</h1>
    <p>Many of the AFMâ€™s recording agreements are applicable in Canada as well as the United States, such as the Sound Recording agreements and the Film agreements. </p>
    <p>There are many others, however, that do not apply in both countries. The live television agreements cover U.S. productions, though airing in Canada does not constitute foreign use. Canadian broadcasters, such as the CBC and TVO have their own agreements with the Canadian office.</p>
    <p>Moreover, each country also has their own Commercial Announcements Agreement.</p>
    <p>The information available on this website is generally written with U.S. production in mind. For more information on Canadian-only agreements, please visit the CFM website.</p>
