    <h1>Low Budget Theatrical Motion Pictures</h1>
    <p>Section VIII. of the AFM’s Basic Theatrical Motion Picture Agreement outlines the wage scales, hours of employment, and working conditions for the production of music scoring for low budget motion pictures in the United States (these provisions do not apply in Canada.)</p>
    <p>Applications for the use of low budget terms and conditions, including the initial best estimate of the final cost must be certified by the head of production and submitted to the AFM no later than 96 hours prior to the first scoring session. The final estimated cost must be certified and submitted to the Federation within 30 days of the release of any such motion picture. Failure to provide such final cost shall result in an automatic upgrade to full scale.</p>
    <p>Paragraph 61 of the Agreement covers conditions for theatrical motion pictures budgeted at $45 million or less (“Low Budget”).</p>
    <p>Paragraph 62 covers conditions for theatrical motion pictures budgeted at $15 million or less (“Ultra Low Budget”).  At least one scoring session for a film using these terms must employ 15 or more musicians.</p>
    <p>Paragraph 63 covers conditions for theatrical motion pictures budgeted at $2 million or less which employ at least 7 musicians on at least one scoring session. These rates are also Ultra Low Budget and are identical to the rates in Paragraph 62.</p>
    <p>All musicians must be notified when they are initially engaged that the terms of their engagement shall be governed by the provisions of one of these paragraphs.</p>
    <p>For Low Budget and Ultra Low Budget motion pictures, there is no requirement to pay Vacation Pay; however, the required pension contribution is at a higher rate.</p>
    <p>For independent producers with projects budgeted under $2 million and intended for exhibition at film festivals, please see our page on <a href="festival-films.html">Festival Films</a>.</p>
