    <title>AFM EMSD: Internet Streaming</title>

<body>
    <h1>Internet Streaming</h1>
    <p>Many AFM agreements contain provisions that indicate what happens if the material produced under them is later streamed online. However, what happens if something like a live event is captured specifically for the purpose of being streamed online (that is to say, the online stream is the <i>operative agreement</i>, rather than the work falling under a different recording CBA)? </p>
    <p>The AFM promulgates five different Internet streaming agreements for a variety of different stream types. They are all arranged on a case-by-case basis between the Employer and the Federation.</p>
    <p>The <b>Live Streaming Agreement</b> covers work that is streamed live, as it happens, and then is removed immediately.</p>
    <p>The <b>On-Demand Streaming Agreement</b> may cover work that is streamed live, as it happens, as well, but further covers that the stream is left online to be accessed at a later time by the consumer (as on YouTube, for example).</p>
    <p>The <b>Edited Concert Agreement</b> covers when a concert capture is edited and made available online by individual song. It was developed to prevent circumvention of <a href="location-recordings.html">Location Recordings</a> and <a href="music-videos.html">Music Videos</a> under the Sound Recording agreement. </p>
    <p>The <b>Video Performance Agreement</b> covers instances where a band is called to perform on-camera, recording what are usually alternate versions of their songs. These are staged performances of songs that differ from <a href="music-videos.html">Traditional Music Videos</a>, but are not captured from live, ticketed concerts.</p>
    <p>The <b>3-Minute Promotional Agreement</b> allows for individual employers signed to a Local live engagement agreement to capture that agreement and, for an additional 10% of the live engagement scale, utilize clips on social media to advertise other upcoming live engagements. </p>
    <p>All streaming work is filed on an AFM B-7 Report Form.</p>
