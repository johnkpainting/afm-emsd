    <h1>Theatrical Motion Pictures</h1>
    <p>The AFM <b>Basic Theatrical Motion Picture Agreement</b> covers musicians who are employed by employers for the production of “theatrical motion pictures,” which means movies initially released in theatrical exhibition.</p>
    <p>This agreement includes multiple <a href="low-budget-motion-picture.html">low budget thresholds</a>, each of which requires the project to fall under a certain budget limit while also guaranteeing the employment of a specific minimum number of musicians.</p>
    <p>All motion picture work is filed on an AFM B-7 Report Form.</p>
