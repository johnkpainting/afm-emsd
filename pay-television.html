    <title>AFM EMSD: Non-Standard Television</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Non-Standard (Pay) Television Agreement</h1>
    <p>Similar to the <a href="videotape.html">Live Television (Videotape) Agreement</a>, the AFM <b>Non-Standard Television Agreement</b> covers musicians engaged for variety programming intended to air on pay cable networks, such as HBO, Cinemax, and Showtime.</p>
    <p>As in the Videotape Agreement for network television, work is assumed to be on-camera, so the rates herein cover both audio and visual capture. The actual program rates themselves depend on two factors: how long the program is and how often it airs. Based on that, a show’s “minimum call” rate will comprise the “air rate” for time spent taping the show as well as a minimum number of required rehearsal hours.</p>
    <p>Broadcast patterns are more similar to <a href="basic-cable.html">Basic Cable</a> than to network television; the initial compensation fee covers broadcast on up to 8 “play dates” in a 6-month time period.</p>
    <p>All premium cable work is filed on an AFM B-8 Report Form.</p>
