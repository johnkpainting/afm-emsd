    <h1>Archival Agreements</h1>
    <p>An “archival recording” occurs when a live engagement is captured for the purposes of future review by the Producer and the Producer only. Archival recordings are not permitted to be broadcast or disseminated in any way, shape, or form. Moreover, a recording engagement cannot be called for the purpose of being an archival recording, if outside of the scope of a live engagement or steady collective bargaining agreement.</p>
    <p>Most likely, if you are looking to capture a recording for purposes such as demonstration to potential financial backers, the <a href="audio-demos.html">Audio Demonstration Recording Agreement</a> is a better fit.</p>
    <p>The AFM has a <b>Visual Archival Agreement</b> to cover the capture, with no more than two cameras, of a live engagement for the purposes of review. If such a capture is intended for sale or other dissemination, it may better fit under the <b>Limited Release DVD Agreement</b>.</p>
